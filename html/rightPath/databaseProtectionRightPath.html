    <section>
        <h2>2. Determine Eligibility</h2>
        <p>Check if your database qualifies for protection, typically requiring a substantial investment in obtaining,
            verifying, or presenting the contents.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>3. Assess the Content</h2>
        <p>Assess the originality and substantiality of the content within your database to determine if it meets the
            criteria for protection.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>4. Secure Ownership</h2>
        <p>Ensure that you have ownership or rights to use the data contained within the database, including obtaining
            necessary permissions or licenses.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>5. Document the Database</h2>
        <p>Document the creation process, investment, and contents of the database to establish evidence of ownership
            and investment for potential legal proceedings.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>6. Apply for Protection</h2>
        <p>File an application for database rights protection with the relevant intellectual property office or
            authority, providing evidence of investment and ownership.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>7. Examination Process</h2>
        <p>Your application will undergo an examination process to verify the eligibility and substantiality of the
            database contents.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>8. Grant of Rights</h2>
        <p>If your database rights application meets the requirements, you will be granted exclusive rights to control
            certain uses of the database for a specified period.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>9. Enforcement</h2>
        <p>If someone infringes your database rights, you can take legal action to enforce your rights and seek remedies
            such as damages or injunctions.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>10. Continuous Maintenance</h2>
