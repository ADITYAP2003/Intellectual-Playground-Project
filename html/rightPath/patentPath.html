        <h2>1. Understand Patent Protection</h2>

            selling the invention without permission.</p>

            usefulness.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>3. Conduct Patent Search</h2>
        <p>Perform a thorough patent search to ensure your invention is novel and not already patented by someone else.

            objections.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>7. Obtain Patent Grant</h2>
        <p>If your patent application is approved, you will receive a patent grant giving you exclusive rights to your
            invention.</p>

        <h2>9. Enforce Patent Rights</h2>
        <p>If someone infringes your patent, you can enforce your rights through legal action, such as filing a patent
            infringement lawsuit.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>10. Continuously Innovate</h2>
        <p>Continue innovating and improving your invention to stay ahead of competitors and maintain the value of your
