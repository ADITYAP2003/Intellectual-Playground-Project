    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>1. Understand Geographical Indications (GIs)</h2>
        <p>Geographical indications identify products as originating from a particular region or locality, where a
            certain quality, reputation, or other characteristic is essentially attributable to its geographical
            origin.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>2. Identify Eligible Products</h2>
        <p>Identify products that have unique qualities or characteristics derived from their geographical origin and
            may qualify for geographical indication protection.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>3. Research Existing GIs</h2>
        <p>Conduct research to determine if there are existing geographical indications for similar products in your
            region or in other jurisdictions.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>4. Establish Producer Association</h2>
        <p>Establish a producer association or group to represent the interests of producers and stakeholders involved
            in the production of the geographical indication product.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>5. Document Product Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Document the unique qualities, production methods, and other characteristics that define the geographical
            indication product.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>6. Apply for Protection</h2>
        <p>File an application for geographical indication protection with the relevant intellectual property office or
            authority, providing evidence of the product's distinctiveness and link to its geographical origin.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>7. Examination and Registration</h2>
        <p>Your application will undergo examination to verify the eligibility and distinctiveness of the geographical
            indication. If approved, it will be registered.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>8. Enforcement of Rights</h2>
        <p>Enforce your geographical indication rights against unauthorized use by third parties, including
            imitations or misuses that could mislead consumers.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>9. Promotion and Marketing</h2>
        <p>Promote and market your geographical indication product to raise awareness of its unique qualities and
            geographical origin among consumers.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>10. International Recognition</h2>
        <p>Seek international recognition and protection for your geographical indication through treaties or
            agreements that recognize GIs.</p>
