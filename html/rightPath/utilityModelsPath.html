        <h1>Path of Utility Models</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>1. Understand Utility Models</h2>
        <p>Utility models provide protection for inventions that offer practical utility or function, but may not meet
            the inventive step required for a patent. They are often quicker and less expensive to obtain than patents.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>2. Assess Eligibility</h2>
        <p>Check if your invention qualifies for utility model protection, typically requiring novelty and industrial
            applicability but with a lower inventive step threshold compared to patents.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>3. Conduct Prior Art Search</h2>
        <p>Conduct a prior art search to ensure that your invention is novel and not already disclosed or claimed by
            existing utility models, patents, or other publications.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>4. Prepare Utility Model Application</h2>
        <p>Draft a utility model application including detailed descriptions and drawings of your invention, as well
            as claims defining the scope of protection.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>5. File Utility Model Application</h2>
        <p>Submit your utility model application to the relevant intellectual property office along with the required
            fees.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>6. Examination Process</h2>
        <p>Your utility model application will undergo an examination process to assess its novelty and industrial
            applicability.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>7. Grant of Utility Model Rights</h2>
        <p>If your utility model application meets the requirements, you will be granted utility model rights, giving
            you exclusive rights to your invention for a limited period.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>8. Enforcement</h2>
        <p>If someone infringes your utility model rights, you can take legal action to enforce your rights and seek
            remedies such as injunctions or damages.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>9. Maintenance and Renewal</h2>
        <p>Ensure to comply with maintenance and renewal requirements to keep your utility model rights in force for
            the maximum protection period.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>10. Continuous Innovation</h2>
        <p>Continue innovating and developing new utility model inventions to expand your intellectual property
            portfolio and maintain a competitive edge.</p>
