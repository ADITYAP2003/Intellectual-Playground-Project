        <h2>What are Plant Variety Rights? 🌾</h2>
        <p>Plant variety rights are a form of intellectual property protection granted to breeders of new plant
            varieties. They give breeders exclusive rights to produce, sell, and distribute their new plant varieties
            for a certain period of time. 🕰️</p>

        <h2>Why are Plant Variety Rights Important? 🚀</h2>
        <p>Plant variety rights are important because they encourage innovation and investment in plant breeding. They
            provide breeders with the incentive to develop new and improved plant varieties by giving them exclusive
            rights to benefit from their efforts. 💡</p>

        <h2>How Do Plant Variety Rights Work? 🌿</h2>
        <p>To obtain plant variety rights, breeders must apply for protection with the relevant intellectual property
            office. They need to demonstrate that their new plant variety is distinct, uniform, stable, and has novelty.
            Once granted, plant variety rights give breeders exclusive rights to control the propagation and
            commercialization of their variety. 📝</p>

        <h2>Examples of Plant Variety Rights 🌻</h2>
        <p>Some examples of plant variety rights include rights granted to breeders of new varieties of crops like
            wheat, rice, fruits, and vegetables. These rights ensure that breeders can benefit from their investment in
            developing new and improved plant varieties. 🥕</p>
