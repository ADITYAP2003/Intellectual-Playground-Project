        <h2>What are Database Rights? 🗃️</h2>
        <p>Database rights are a type of legal protection given to the creators of databases. They give the creators
            exclusive rights to control certain uses of their databases. 🛡️</p>

        <h2>What is a Database? 💾</h2>
        <p>A database is like a big collection of information stored in a computer. It can be a list of names and
            addresses, a collection of pictures, or even a library catalog! 📚</p>

        <h2>Why are Database Rights Important? 🚀</h2>
        <p>Database rights are important because they protect the hard work of people who create and organize
            databases. Without these rights, anyone could use or copy someone else's database without permission, and
            the creators wouldn't get the credit or the payment they deserve for their efforts. 💡</p>

        <h2>What Does Database Rights Mean for You? 🧒</h2>
        <p>For you, understanding database rights means respecting other people's work. Just like you wouldn't take
            someone's toy without asking, you shouldn't use someone's database without permission. Always ask for
            permission first! 🤝</p>

        <h2>How Can You Respect Database Rights? 🤔</h2>
        <p>To respect database rights, always ask for permission before using someone else's database. If you're not
            sure if something is okay to use, it's best to ask an adult for help. By doing this, you show that you
            value the hard work of others! 📝</p>

            <h3>Remember: 🌐</h3>
            <p>Just because something is available online doesn't mean it's free for anyone to use! Always check if you
                have permission to use or share something before doing so. 🔍</p>
