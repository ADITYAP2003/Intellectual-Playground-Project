        <h2>What is a Patent? 🔍</h2>
        <p>A patent is a legal protection granted by a government to an inventor. It gives the inventor the exclusive
            right to make, use, and sell their invention for a certain period of time. 🕰️</p>

        <h2>Types of Patents 📝</h2>
        <p>There are different types of patents, including utility patents (for new and useful inventions), design
            patents (for new, original, and ornamental designs), and plant patents (for new varieties of plants). Each
            type of patent protects different aspects of innovation. 🌱</p>

        <h2>Why are Patents Important? 🚀</h2>
        <p>Patents are important because they encourage innovation and protect the rights of inventors. They provide
            inventors with the incentive to invest time and resources into developing new and useful inventions by
            giving them exclusive rights to profit from their ideas. 💡</p>

        <h2>What Does a Patent Mean for You? 🧒</h2>
        <p>For you, understanding patents means recognizing the value of new ideas and inventions. It's like knowing
            that the latest smartphone or medical device you use was created by someone who had the opportunity to
            protect their innovation with a patent. 🌟</p>

        <h2>How Can You Identify a Patent? 🤔</h2>
        <p>To identify whether something is protected by a patent, you can search patent databases online. If an
            invention has been granted a patent, it will be listed in the database along with details about its
            inventor, the patent number, and the claims of the invention. 🔍</p>

            <h3>Remember: 🌐</h3>
            <p>Respecting patents means respecting the rights of inventors and creators. It's important to support
                innovation by respecting the exclusive rights granted by patents. 🛠️</p>
