        <h2>What is a Trademark? 🏷️</h2>
        <p>A trademark is a special sign that helps us recognize and identify certain products or services. It can be a
            symbol, word, or design that shows us where something comes from. 🛡️</p>

        <h2>What Can Be Trademarked? 🧸</h2>
        <p>Logos, brand names, slogans, and even sounds or colors can be trademarked. For example, think about your
            favorite toy's logo or the name of a famous cartoon character – those are trademarks! 🎨</p>

        <h2>Why are Trademarks Important? 🚀</h2>
        <p>Trademarks are important because they help us know that a product or service is genuine and comes from a
            trusted source. They also help companies protect their brands from being copied by others. 💡</p>

        <h2>What Does a Trademark Mean for You? 🧒</h2>
        <p>For you, knowing about trademarks means understanding the special symbols or names that represent your
            favorite things. It's like recognizing your friend's backpack by its unique design or color – you know it's
            theirs! 🤝</p>

        <h2>How Can You Respect Trademarks? 🤔</h2>
        <p>To respect trademarks, avoid using someone else's brand name or logo without permission. Just like you
            wouldn't pretend to be someone else, you shouldn't use their trademark without asking. Always look for
            brands you trust and support them by choosing their genuine products! 🎭</p>

            <h3>Remember: 🌐</h3>
            <p>Even if something looks similar to a famous brand, it might not be the real thing. Always check for the
                official trademark to make sure you're getting the genuine product! 🔍</p>
