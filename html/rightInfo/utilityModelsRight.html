        <h2>What are Utility Models? 🔧</h2>
        <p>Utility models are a form of intellectual property protection granted to inventions that provide a practical
            solution to a problem. They are similar to patents but typically have shorter terms of protection and may
            have less stringent requirements for inventive step. 📐</p>

        <h2>Why are Utility Models Important? 🚀</h2>
        <p>Utility models are important because they encourage innovation and protect the rights of inventors. They
            provide inventors with a faster and often more affordable way to protect their inventions compared to
            patents. 💡</p>

        <h2>How Do Utility Models Work? 📏</h2>
        <p>To obtain utility model protection, inventors must demonstrate that their invention is new and has industrial
            applicability. Unlike patents, utility models may have less stringent requirements for inventive step,
            making them a more accessible form of protection for incremental improvements or modifications to existing
            inventions. 🛠️</p>

        <h2>Examples of Utility Models 📋</h2>
        <p>Some examples of inventions protected by utility models include tools, gadgets, household appliances, and
            mechanical devices. These inventions provide practical solutions to everyday problems and can benefit from
            utility model protection. 🔩</p>

            <h3>Remember: 🌐</h3>
            <p>Respecting utility models means recognizing the value of practical inventions and supporting innovation
                in all its forms. It's important to respect the rights of inventors and creators by upholding utility
                model protection. 🛠️</p>
