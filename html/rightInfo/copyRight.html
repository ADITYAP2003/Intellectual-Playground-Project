        <h2>What is Copyright? 🖋️</h2>
        <p>Copyright is a legal protection given to creators of original work. It gives them the exclusive right to use
            and distribute their work. 🛡️</p>

        <h2>What Can Be Copyrighted? 🎨</h2>
        <p>Books, music, movies, art, and even computer programs are examples of things that can be copyrighted. This
            means that if you create something new, like a story, a song, or a drawing, you automatically have copyright
            protection for it! 🌟</p>

        <h2>Why is Copyright Important? 🚀</h2>
        <p>Copyright is important because it protects the hard work of creators. Without copyright protection, anyone
            could use or copy someone else's work without permission, and creators wouldn't get the credit or the
            payment they deserve for their efforts. 💡</p>

        <h2>What Does Copyright Mean for You? 🧒</h2>
        <p>For you, understanding copyright means respecting other people's work. It's like asking before borrowing a
            friend's toy – you wouldn't take it without asking, right? The same goes for using someone's picture, video,
            or music. Always ask for permission first! 🤝</p>

        <h2>How Can You Respect Copyright? 🤔</h2>
        <p>To respect copyright, always ask for permission before using someone else's work. If you're not sure if
            something is okay to use, it's best to ask an adult for help. By doing this, you show that you value the
            hard work and creativity of others! 🎭</p>

            <h3>Remember: 🌐</h3>
            <p>Just because something is on the internet doesn't mean it's free for anyone to use! Always check if you
                have permission to use or share something before doing so. 🔍</p>
