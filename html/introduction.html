            <ul>
                <li><strong>Copyrights:</strong> Protect original works of authorship, such as books, music, and movies.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Trademarks:</strong> Protect symbols, names, and slogans used to identify products or
                    services.</li>
                <li><strong>Patents:</strong> Protect inventions or discoveries, granting the inventor exclusive rights
                    for a limited time.</li>
